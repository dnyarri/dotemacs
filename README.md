dotemacs
========

I'm trying to configure my emacs from scratch after using starter-kit and prelude. I'm not very experienced with elisp though, and I won't be updating this often. This is mostly for my own purposes so that I can easily move my emacs-configuration. Note that my configuration doesn't automatically install needed packages (needs to be fixed).

I use Emacs for pretty much everything else but C/C++ . For C/C++, I recommend Qt Creator or KDevelop (my favourite). This of course, is just my personal opinion.

Since my configurations are pretty trivial, I'm putting this into public domain (see UNLICENSE for more information)
