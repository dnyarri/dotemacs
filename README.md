dotemacs
========

I'm trying to configure my emacs from scratch after using starter-kit and prelude. I'm not very experienced with elisp though, and I won't be updating this often.

Since my configurations are pretty trivial, I'm putting this into public domain (see UNLICENSE for more information)
